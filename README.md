## Technologies Used

    IntelliJ
    
    VSCode Live

    Docker
    
    Postgres
    
    Psql  

## General Approach

    The general approach was to build each individual microservice with full CRUD functionality and then added on as needed to fulfill the front end routes required.
    

## Unsolved problems and other hurdles

    The only unsolved problem left was the editing of user profile. It seems to be a CORS issue, but CORS issue was already solved before.
